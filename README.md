# sv-report
Evaluation of multiple SV callers

Our aim is to assess the performance of the structural variants (SV) callers that are part of the [sv-callers](https://github.com/GooglingTheCancerGenome/sv-callers) workflow:
* [DELLY](https://github.com/dellytools/delly)
* [LUMPY](https://github.com/arq5x/lumpy-sv)
* [Manta](https://github.com/Illumina/manta)
* [GRIDSS](https://github.com/PapenfussLab/gridss)
